# Description

After going through a coding block for about a week, I was just surfing the web and came across Medium's website and i thought to myself 'Why not try this out'. I saw their layout was quite daring and i decided to pick up the project. In this project, i got to know a lot about some new CSS properties. I did a lot of work on the responsiveness which also taught me the need for wire-framing on a seperate sheet for reference purposes. I faced some challenges using the CSS fixed and sticky properties, as i learned while working on the project that one has to give an element a height for these properties to work. This project is one of the very few projects that i am proud of.
